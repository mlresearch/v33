	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		In finite decision problems where an agent can query its human user to obtain information about its environment before acting, a query’s usefulness is in terms of its Expected Value of Information (EVOI). The usefulness of a query set is similarly measured in terms of the EVOI of the queries it contains. When the only constraint on what queries can be asked is that they have exactly k possible responses (with <span class="math">\(k \ge 2\)</span>), we show that the set of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-response decision queries (which ask the user to select his/her preferred decision given a choice of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> decisions) is EVOI-Sufficient, meaning that no single <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-response query can have higher EVOI than the best single <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-response decision query for any decision problem. When multiple queries can be asked before acting, we provide a negative result that shows the set of depth-<span class="math">\(n\)</span> query trees constructed from <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-response decision queries is not EVOI-Sufficient. However, we also provide a positive result that the set of depth-<span class="math">\(n\)</span> query trees constructed from <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-response decision-set queries, which ask the user to select from among <span class="math">\(k\)</span> sets of decisions as to which set contains the best decision, is EVOI-Sufficient. We conclude with a discussion and analysis of algorithms that draws on a connection to other recent work on decision-theoretic knowledge elicitation.
