	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		In active learning, the user sequentially chooses values for feature <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and an oracle returns the corresponding label <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>. In this paper, we consider the effect of feature noise in active learning, which could arise either because <span class="math">\(X\)</span> itself is being measured, or it is corrupted in transmission to the oracle, or the oracle returns the label of a noisy version of the query point. In statistics, feature noise is known as“errors in variables” and has been studied extensively in non-active settings. However, the effect of feature noise in active learning has not been studied before. We consider the well-known Berkson errors-in-variables model with additive uniform noise of width <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>. Our simple but revealing setting is that of one-dimensional binary classification setting where the goal is to learn a threshold (point where the probability of a <span class="math">\(+\)</span> label crosses half). We deal with regression functions that are antisymmetric in a region of size <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> around the threshold and also satisfy Tsybakov’s margin condition around the threshold. We prove minimax lower and upper bounds which demonstrate that when <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is smaller than the minimiax active/passive noiseless error derived in Castro &amp; Nowak (2007), then noise has no effect on the rates and one achieves the same noiseless rates. For larger <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>, the <em>unflattening</em> of the regression function on convolution with uniform noise, along with its local antisymmetry around the threshold, together yield a behaviour where noise <em>appears</em> to be beneficial. Our key result is that active learning can buy significant improvement over a passive strategy even in the presence of feature noise.
