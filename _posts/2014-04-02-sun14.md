title: " Adaptive Variable Clustering in Gaussian Graphical Models"
abstract: Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are widely-used to describe the relationship
  between random variables. In many real-world applications, GGMs have a block structure
  in the sense that the variables can be clustered into groups so that inter-group
  correlation is much weaker than intra-group correlation. We present a novel nonparametric
  Bayesian generative model for such a block-structured GGM and an efficient inference
  algorithm to find the clustering of variables in this GGM by combining a Gibbs sampler
  and a split-merge Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Experimental results show that
  our method performs well on both synthetic and real data. In particular, our method
  outperforms generic clustering algorithms and can automatically identify the true
  number of clusters.
