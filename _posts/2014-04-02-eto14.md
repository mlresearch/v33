title: "{Fully-Automatic Bayesian Piecewise Sparse Linear Models}"
abstract: Piecewise linear models (PLMs) have been widely used in many enterprise
  machine learning problems, which assign linear experts to individual partitions
  on feature spaces and express whole models as patches of local experts. This paper
  addresses simultaneous model selection issues of PLMs; partition structure determination
  and feature selection of individual experts. Our contributions are mainly three-fold.
  First, we extend factorized asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference for hierarchical
  mixtures of experts (probabilistic PLMs). FAB inference offers penalty terms w.r.t.
  partition and expert complexities, and enable us to resolve the model selection
  issue. Second, we propose posterior optimization which significantly improves predictive
  accuracy. Roughly speaking, our new posterior optimization mitigates accuracy degradation
  due to a gap between marginal log-likelihood maximization and predictive accuracy.
  Third, we present an application of energy demand forecasting as well as benchmark
  comparisons. The experiments show our capability of acquiring compact and highly-accurate
  models.
