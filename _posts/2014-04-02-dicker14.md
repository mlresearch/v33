title: Sparsity and the Truncated $l^2$-norm
abstract: Sparsity is a fundamental topic in high-dimensional data analysis.  Perhaps
  the most common measures of sparsity are the $l^p$-norms, for $p < 2$.  In this paper,
  we study an alternative measure of sparsity, the truncated $l^2$-norm, which is related
  to other $l^p$-norms, but appears to have some unique and useful properties.  Focusing
  on the n-dimensional Gaussian location model, we derive exact asymptotic minimax
  results for estimation over truncated $l^2$-balls, which complement existing results
  for $l^p$-balls.  We then propose simple new adaptive thresholding estimators that
  are inspired by the truncated $l^2$-norm and are adaptive asymptotic minimax over
  $l^p$-balls ($p < 2$), as well as truncated $l^2$-balls.  Finally, we derive lower bounds
  on the Bayes risk of an estimator, in terms of the parameterâ€™s truncated $l^2$-norm.  These
  bounds provide necessary conditions for Bayes risk consistency in certain problems
  that are relevant for high-dimensional Bayesian modeling.
