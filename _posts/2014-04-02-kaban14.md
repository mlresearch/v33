title: "{New Bounds on Compressive Linear Least Squares Regression}"
abstract: In this paper we provide a new analysis of compressive least squares regression
  that removes a spurious log N factor from previous bounds, where N is the number
  of training points. Our new bound has a clear interpretation and reveals meaningful
  structural properties of the linear regression problem that makes it solvable effectively
  in a small dimensional random subspace. In addition, the main part of our analysis
  does not require the compressive matrix to have the Johnson-Lindenstrauss property,
  or the RIP property. Instead, we only require its entries to be drawn i.i.d. from
  a 0-mean symmetric distribution with finite first four moments.
