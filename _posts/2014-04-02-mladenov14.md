title: "{Efficient Lifting of MAP LP Relaxations Using k-Locality}"
abstract: Inference in large scale graphical models is an important task in many domains,
  and in particular for probabilistic relational models (e.g,. Markov logic networks).
  Such models often exhibit considerable symmetry, and it is a challenge to devise
  algorithms that exploit this symmetry to speed up inference.   Here we address this
  task in the context of the MAP inference problem and its linear programming relaxations.
  We show that symmetry in these problems  can be discovered using an elegant algorithm
  known as the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (k-WL) algorithm. We run k-WL on the
  original graphical model, and not on the far larger graph of the linear program
  (LP) as proposed in earlier work in the field. Furthermore, the algorithm is polynomial
  and thus far more practical than other previous approaches which rely on orbit partitions
  that are GI complete to find. The fact that k-WL can be used in this manner follows
  from the recently introduced notion of k-local LPs and their relation to Sherali
  Adams relaxations of graph automorphisms. Finally, for relational models such as
  Markov logic networks, the benefits of our approach are even more dramatic, as we
  can discover symmetries in the original domain graph, as opposed to running lifting
  on the much larger grounded model.
