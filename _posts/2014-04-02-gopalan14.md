title: "{Bayesian Nonparametric Poisson Factorization for Recommendation Systems}"
abstract: We develop a Bayesian nonparametric Poisson factorization model for recommendation
  systems. Poisson factorization implicitly models each userâ€™s limited budget of attention
  (or money) that allows consumption of only a small subset of the available items.  In
  our Bayesian nonparametric variant, the number of latent components is theoretically
  unbounded and effectively estimated when computing a posterior with observed user
  behavior data.  To approximate the posterior, we develop an efficient variational
  inference algorithm. It adapts the dimensionality of the latent components to the
  data, only requires iteration over the user/item pairs that have been rated, and
  has computational complexity on the same order as for a parametric model with fixed
  dimensionality.  We studied our model and algorithm with large real-world data sets
  of user-movie preferences.  Our model eases the computational burden of searching
  for the number of latent components and gives better predictive performance than
  its parametric counterpart.
