title: "{High-Dimensional Density Ratio Estimation with Extensions to Approximate
  Likelihood Computation}"
abstract: The ratio between two probability density functions is an important component
  of various tasks, including selection bias correction, novelty detection and classification.  Recently,
  several estimators of this ratio have been proposed. Most of these methods fail
  if the sample space is high-dimensional, and hence require a dimension reduction
  step, the result of which can be a significant loss of information. Here we propose
  a simple-to-implement, fully nonparametric density ratio estimator that expands
  the ratio in terms of the eigenfunctions of a kernel-based operator; these functions
  reflect the underlying geometry of the data (e.g., submanifold structure), often
  leading to better estimates without an explicit dimension reduction step.  We show
  how our general framework can be extended to address another important problem,
  the estimation of a likelihood function in situations where that function cannot
  be well-approximated by an analytical form. One is often faced with this situation
  when performing statistical inference with data from the sciences, due the complexity
  of the data and of the processes that generated those data. We emphasize applications
  where using existing likelihood-free methods of inference would be challenging due
  to the high dimensionality of the sample space, but where our spectral series method
  yields a reasonable estimate of the likelihood function. We provide theoretical
  guarantees and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method with numerical
  experiments.
