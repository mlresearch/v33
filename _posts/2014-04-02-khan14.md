title: "{Scalable Collaborative Bayesian Preference Learning}"
abstract: Learning about usersâ€™ utilities from preference, discrete choice or implicit
  feedback data is of integral importance in e-commerce, targeted advertising and
  web search. Due to the sparsity and diffuse nature of data, Bayesian approaches  hold
  much promise, yet most prior work does not scale up to realistic data sizes. We
  shed light on why inference for such settings is computationally   difficult for
  standard machine learning methods, most of which focus on predicting explicit ratings
  only. To simplify the difficulty, we present a novel expectation maximization algorithm,
  driven by expectation propagation approximate inference, which scales to very large
  datasets without requiring strong factorization assumptions. Our  utility model
  uses both latent bilinear collaborative filtering and non-parametric Gaussian process
  (GP) regression. In experiments on large real-world  datasets, our method gives
  substantially better results than either matrix factorization or GPs in isolation,
  and converges significantly faster.
