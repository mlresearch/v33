title: "{Cluster Canonical Correlation Analysis}"
abstract: In this paper we present cluster canonical correlation analysis (cluster-CCA)
  for joint dimensionality reduction of two sets of data points.  Unlike the standard
  pairwise correspondence between the  data points, in our problem each set is partitioned
  into multiple clusters or classes, where the class labels define correspondences
  between the sets. Cluster-CCA is able to learn discriminant low dimensional representations
  that maximize the correlation between the two sets while segregating the different
  classes on the learned space.  Furthermore, we present a kernel extension, kernel
  cluster canonical correlation analysis (cluster-KCCA) that extends cluster-CCA to
  account for non-linear relationships.  Cluster-(K)CCA is shown to be computationally
  efficient, the complexity being similar to standard (K)CCA. By means of experimental
  evaluation on benchmark datasets, cluster-(K)CCA is shown to achieve state of the
  art performance for cross-modal retrieval tasks.
