title: Active Boundary Annotation using Random MAP Perturbations
abstract: We address the problem of efficiently annotating labels of objects when
  they are structured. Often the distribution over labels can be described using a
  joint potential function over the labels for which sampling is provably hard but
  efficient maximum a-posteriori (MAP) solvers exist. In this setting we develop novel
  entropy bounds that are based on the expected amount of perturbation to the potential
  function that is needed to change MAP decisions. By reasoning about the entropy
  reduction and cost tradeoff, our algorithm actively selects the next annotation
  task. As an example of our framework we propose a boundary refinement task which
  can used to obtain pixel-accurate image boundaries much faster than traditional
  tools by focussing on parts of the image for refinement in a multi-scale manner.
