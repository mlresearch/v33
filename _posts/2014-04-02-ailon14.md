title: "{Improved Bounds for Online Learning Over the Permutahedron and Other Ranking
  Polytopes}"
abstract: 'Consider the following game: There is a fixed set V of n items.  At each
  step an adversary chooses a score function  s_t:V\mapsto[0,1], a learner outputs
  a  ranking of V, and then s_t is revealed.  The learner’s loss is the sum over v∈V,
  of s_t(v) times v’s  position (0th, 1st, 2nd, ...) in the ranking.  This problem
  captures, for example, online systems that iteratively present ranked lists of items
  to users, who then respond by choosing one (or more) sought items.  The loss measures
  the users’ burden, which increases the further the sought items are from the top.  It
  also captures a version of online rank aggregation.      We present an algorithm
  of expected regret  O(n\sqrtOPT + n^2), where OPT is the loss of the best (single)
  ranking in hindsight.   This improves the previously best known  algorithm of Suehiro
  et. al (2012) by saving a factor of Ω(\sqrt\log n).  We also reduce the per-step
  running time  from O(n^2) to O(n\log n).   We provide matching lower bounds.'
