title: "{Analytic Long-Term Forecasting with Periodic Gaussian Processes}"
abstract: Gaussian processes are a state-of-the-art method for learning    models
  from data. Data with an underlying periodic structure appears    in many areas,
  e.g., in climatology or robotics.  It is often    important to predict the long-term
  evolution of such a time series,    and to take the inherent periodicity explicitly
  into account.  In a    Gaussian process, periodicity can be accounted for by an
  appropriate kernel    choice. However, the standard periodic kernel does not allow
  for    analytic long-term forecasting, which requires to map distributions    through
  the Gaussian process.  To address this shortcoming, we re-parametrize the periodic
  kernel,    which, in combination with a double approximation, allows for    analytic
  long-term forecasting of a periodic state evolution with    Gaussian processes.  Our
  model allows for probabilistic long-term forecasting of periodic    processes, which
  can be valuable in Bayesian decision making,    optimal control, reinforcement learning,
  and robotics.
