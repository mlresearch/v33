title: "{Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Relational Learning with One Network}"
abstract: This theoretical paper is concerned with a rigorous non-asymptotic analysis
  of relational learning applied to a single network. Under suitable and intuitive
  conditions on features and clique dependencies over the network, we present the
  first probably approximately correct (PAC) bound for maximum likelihood estimation
  (MLE). To our best knowledge, this is the first sample complexity result of this
  problem. We propose a novel combinational approach to analyze complex dependencies
  of relational data, which is crucial to our non-asymptotic analysis. The consistency
  of MLE under our conditions is also proved as the consequence of our sample complexity
  bound. Finally, our combinational method for analyzing dependent data can be easily
  generalized to treat other generalized maximum likelihood estimators for relational
  learning.
