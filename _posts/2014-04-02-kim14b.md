title: Scalable Variational Bayesian Matrix Factorization with Side Information
abstract: Bayesian matrix factorization (BMF) is a popular method for collaborative
  prediction, because of its robustness to overfitting as well as of being free from
  cross-validation for fine tuning of regularization parameters. In practice, however,
  due to its cubic time complexity with respect to the rank of factor matrices, existing
  variational inference algorithms for BMF are not well suited to web-scale datasets
  where billions of ratings provided by millions of users are available. The time
  complexity even increases when the side information, such as user binary implicit
  feedback or item content information, is incorporated into variational Bayesian
  matrix factorization (VBMF). For instance, a state of the arts in VBMF with side
  information, is to place Gaussian priors on user and item factor matrices, where
  mean of each prior is regressed on the corresponding side information. Since this
  approach introduces additional cubic time complexity with respect to the size of
  feature vectors, the use of rich side information in a form of high-dimensional
  feature vector is prohibited. In this paper, we present a scalable inference for
  VBMF with side information, the complexity of which is linear in the rank K of factor
  matrices. Moreover, the algorithm can be easily parallelized on multi-core systems.
  Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the useful behavior of our algorithm
  such as scalability, fast learning, and prediction accuracy.
