title: Latent Gaussian Models for Topic Modeling
abstract: A new approach is proposed for topic modeling, in which the latent matrix
  factorization employs Gaussian priors, rather than the Dirichlet-class priors widely
  used in such models. The use of a latent-Gaussian model permits simple and efficient
  approximate Bayesian posterior inference, via the Laplace approximation. On multiple
  datasets, the proposed approach is demonstrated to yield results as accurate as
  state-of-the-art approaches based on Dirichlet constructions, at a small fraction
  of the computation. The framework is general enough to jointly model text and binary
  data, here demonstrated to produce accurate and fast results for joint analysis
  of voting rolls and the associated legislative text. Further, it is demonstrated
  how the technique may be scaled up to massive data, with encouraging performance
  relative to alternative methods.
