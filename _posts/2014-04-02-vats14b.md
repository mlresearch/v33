title: "{Active Learning for Undirected Graphical Model Selection}"
abstract: This paper studies graphical model selection, i.e., the problem of estimating
  a graph of statistical relationships among a collection of random variables.  Conventional
  graphical model selection algorithms are passive, i.e., they require all the measurements
  to have been collected before processing begins.  We propose an active learning
  algorithm that uses junction tree representations to adapt future measurements based
  on the information gathered from prior measurements.  We prove that, under certain
  conditions, our active learning algorithm requires fewer scalar measurements than
  any passive algorithm to reliably estimate a graph.  A range of numerical results
  validate our theory and demonstrates the benefits of active learning.
