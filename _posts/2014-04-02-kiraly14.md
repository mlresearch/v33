title: "{Algebraic Reconstruction Bounds and Explicit Inversion for Phase Retrieval
  at the Identifiability Threshold}"
abstract: We study phase retrieval from magnitude measurements of an unknown signal
  as an algebraic estimation problem. Indeed, phase retrieval from rank-one and more
  general linear measurements can be treated in an algebraic way. It is verified that
  a certain number of generic rank-one or generic linear measurements are sufficient
  to enable signal reconstruction for generic signals, and slightly more generic measurements
  yield reconstructability for all signals. Our results solve few open problems stated
  in the recent literature. Furthermore, we show how the algebraic estimation problem
  can be solved by a closed-form algebraic estimation technique, termed ideal regression,
  providing non-asymptotic success guarantees.
