title: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Optimizing Population Diffusion
abstract: This paper addresses adaptive conservation planning, where the objective
  is to maximize the population spread of a species by allocating limited resources
  over time to conserve land parcels. This problem is characterized by having highly
  stochastic exogenous events (population spread), a large action branching factor
  (number of allocation options) and state space, and the need to reason about numeric
  resources. Together these characteristics render most existing AI planning techniques
  ineffective. The main contribution of this paper is to design and evaluate an online
  planner for this problem based on Hindsight Optimization (HOP), a technique that
  has shown promise in other stochastic planning problems. Unfortunately, standard
  implementations of HOP scale linearly with the number of actions in a domain, which
  is not feasible for conservation problems such as ours. Thus, we develop a new approach
  for computing HOP policies based on mixed-integer programming and dual decomposition.
  Our experiments on synthetic and real-world scenarios show that this approach is
  effective and scalable compared to existing alternatives.
