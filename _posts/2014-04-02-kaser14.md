title: "{Computational Education using Latent Structured Prediction}"
abstract: Computational education offers an important add-on to conventional teaching.
  To provide optimal learning conditions, accurate representation of students’ current
  skills and adaptation to newly acquired knowledge are essential. To obtain sufficient
  representational power we investigate suitability of general graphical models and
  discuss adaptation by learning parameters of a log-linear distribution. For interpretability
  we propose to constrain the parameter space a-priori by leveraging domain knowledge.
  We show the benefits of general graphical models and of regularizing the parameter
  space by evaluation of our models on data collected from a computational education
  software for children having difficulties in learning mathematics.
