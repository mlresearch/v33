title: "{Random Bayesian networks with bounded indegree}"
abstract: Bayesian networks (BN) are an extensively used graphical model for representing
  a probability distribution in artificial intelligence, data mining, and machine
  learning. In this paper, we propose a simple model for large random BNs with bounded
  indegree, that is, large directed acyclic graphs (DAG) where the edges appear at
  random and each node has at most a given number of parents. Using this model, we
  can study useful asymptotic properties of large BNs and BN algorithms with basic
  combinatorics tools. We estimate the expected size of a BN, the expected size increase
  of moralization, the expected size of the Markov blanket, and the maximum size of
  a minimal d-separator. We also provide an upper bound on the average time complexity
  of an algorithm for finding a minimal d-separator. In addition, the estimates are
  evaluated against BNs learned from real world data.
