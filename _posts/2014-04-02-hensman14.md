title: Tilted Variational Bayes
abstract: 'We present a novel method for approximate inference. Using some of the
  constructs from expectation propagation (EP), we derive a lower bound of the marginal
  likelihood in a similar fashion to variational Bayes (VB). The method combines some
  of the benefits of VB and EP: it can be used with light-tailed likelihoods (where
  traditional VB fails), and it provides a lower bound on the marginal likelihood.
  We apply the method to Gaussian process classification, a situation where the Kullback-Leibler
  divergence minimized in traditional VB can be infinite, and to robust Gaussian process
  regression, where the inference process is dramatically simplified in comparison
  to EP.    Code to reproduce all the experiments can be found at github.com/SheffieldML/TVB.'
