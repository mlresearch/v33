title: Bayesian Switching Interaction Analysis Under Uncertainty
abstract: We introduce a Bayesian discrete-time framework for switching-interaction
  analysis under uncertainty, in which latent interactions, switching pattern and
  signal states and dynamics are inferred from noisy (and possibly missing) observations
  of these signals. We propose reasoning over full posterior distribution of these
  latent variables as a means of combating and characterizing uncertainty. This approach
  also allows for answering a variety of questions probabilistically, which is suitable
  for exploratory pattern discovery and post-analysis by human experts. This framework
  is based on a fully-Bayesian learning of the structure of a switching dynamic Bayesian
  network (DBN) and utilizes a state-space approach to allow for noisy observations
  and missing data. It generalizes the autoregressive switching interaction model
  of Siracusa et al., which does not allow observation noise, and the switching linear
  dynamic system model of Fox et al., which does not infer interactions among signals.
  Posterior samples are obtained via a Gibbs sampling procedure, which is particularly
  efficient in the case of linear Gaussian dynamics and observation models. We demonstrate
  the utility of our framework on a controlled human-generated data, and a real-world
  climate data.
