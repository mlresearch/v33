title: Low-Rank Spectral Learning
abstract: 'Spectral learning methods have recently been proposed as  alternatives
  to slow, non-convex optimization algorithms like EM for  a variety of probabilistic
  models in which hidden information must  be inferred by the learner.  These methods
  are typically controlled  by a rank hyperparameter that sets the complexity of the
  model; when  the model rank matches the true rank of the process generating the  data,
  the resulting predictions are provably consistent and admit  finite sample convergence
  bounds.  However, in practice we usually  do not know the true rank, and, in any
  event, from a computational  and statistical standpoint it is likely to be prohibitively
  large.  It is therefore of great practical interest to understand the  behavior
  of low-rank spectral learning, where the model rank is   less than the true rank.  Counterintuitively,
  we show that even   when the singular values omitted by lowering the rank are   arbitrarily
  small, the resulting prediction errors can in fact be  arbitrarily large.  We identify
  two distinct possible causes for  this bad behavior, and illustrate them with simple
  examples.  We  then show that these two causes are essentially complete: assuming  that
  they do not occur, we can prove that the prediction error is  bounded in terms of
  the magnitudes of the omitted singular values.  We argue that the assumptions necessary
  for this result are  relatively realistic, making low-rank spectral learning a viable  option
  for many applications.'
