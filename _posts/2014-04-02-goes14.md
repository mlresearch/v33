title: Robust Stochastic Principal Component Analysis
abstract: We consider the problem of finding lower dimensional subspaces in the presence
  of outliers and noise in the online setting. In particular, we extend previous batch
  formulations of robust PCA to the stochastic setting with minimal storage requirements
  and runtime complexity. We introduce three novel stochastic approximation algorithms
  for robust PCA that are extensions of standard algorithms for PCA - the stochastic
  power method, incremental PCA and online PCA using matrix-exponentiated-gradient
  (MEG) updates. For robust online PCA we also give a sub-linear convergence guarantee.
  Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the the robust online method
  over the other robust stochastic methods and the advantage of robust methods over
  their non-robust counterparts in the presence of outliers in artificial and real
  scenarios.
