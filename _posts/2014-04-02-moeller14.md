title: A Geometric Algorithm for Scalable Multiple Kernel Learning
abstract: We present a geometric formulation of the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL)
  problem.   To do so, we reinterpret the problem of learning kernel weights as searching
  for a kernel that maximizes the minimum (kernel) distance between two convex polytopes.   This
  interpretation combined with additional structural insights from our geometric formulation
  allows us to reduce the MKL problem to a simple optimization routine that yields
  provable convergence as well as quality guarantees. As a result our method scales
  efficiently to much larger data sets than most prior methods can handle. Empirical
  evaluation on eleven datasets shows that we are significantly faster and even compare
  favorably with an uniform unweighted combination of kernels.
