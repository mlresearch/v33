title: "{Explicit Link Between Periodic Covariance Functions and State Space Models}"
abstract: This paper shows how periodic covariance functions in Gaussian process regression
  can be reformulated as state space models, which can be solved with classical Kalman
  filtering theory. This reduces the problematic cubic complexity of Gaussian process
  regression in the number of time steps into linear time complexity. The representation
  is based on expanding periodic covariance functions into a series of stochastic
  resonators. The explicit representation of the canonical periodic covariance function
  is written out and the expansion is shown to uniformly converge to the exact covariance
  function with a known convergence rate. The framework is generalized to quasi-periodic
  covariance functions by introducing damping terms in the system and applied to two
  sets of real data. The approach could be easily extended to non-stationary and spatio-temporal
  variants.
