title: "{Approximate Slice Sampling for Bayesian Posterior Inference}"
abstract: In this paper, we advance the theory of large scale Bayesian posterior inference
  by introducing a new approximate slice sampler that uses only small mini-batches
  of data in every iteration. While this introduces a bias in the stationary distribution,
  the computational savings allow us to draw more samples in a given amount of time
  and reduce sampling variance. We empirically verify on three  different models that
  the approximate slice sampling algorithm can significantly outperform a traditional
  slice sampler if we are allowed only a fixed amount of computing time for our simulations.
