title: Characterizing EVOI-Sufficient k-Response Query Sets in Decision Problems
abstract: In finite decision problems where an agent can query its human user to obtain
  information about its environment before acting, a queryâ€™s usefulness is in terms
  of its Expected Value of Information (EVOI). The usefulness of a query set is similarly
  measured in terms of the EVOI of the queries it contains. When the only constraint
  on what queries can be asked is that they have exactly k possible responses (with
  k \ge 2), we show that the set of k-response decision queries (which ask the user
  to select his/her preferred decision given a choice of k decisions) is EVOI-Sufficient,
  meaning that no single k-response query can have higher EVOI than the best single
  k-response decision query for any decision problem. When multiple queries can be
  asked before acting, we provide a negative result that shows the set of  depth-n
  query trees constructed from k-response decision queries is not EVOI-Sufficient.
  However, we also provide a positive result that the set of depth-n query trees constructed
  from k-response decision-set queries, which ask the user to select from among k
  sets of decisions as to which set contains the best decision,  is EVOI-Sufficient.
  We conclude with a discussion and analysis of algorithms that draws on a connection
  to other recent work on decision-theoretic knowledge elicitation.
