title: "{Collaborative Ranking for Local Preferences}"
abstract: For many collaborative ranking tasks, we have access to relative preferences
  among subsets of items, but not to global preferences among all items. To address
  this, we introduce a matrix factorization framework called Collaborative Local Ranking
  (CLR). We justify CLR by proving a bound on its generalization error, the first
  such bound for collaborative ranking that we know of. We then derive a simple alternating
  minimization algorithm and prove that it converges in sublinear time. Lastly, we
  apply CLR to a novel venue recommendation task and demonstrate that it outperforms
  state-of-the-art collaborative ranking methods on real-world data sets.
