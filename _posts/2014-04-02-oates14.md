title: Joint Structure Learning of Multiple Non-Exchangeable Networks
abstract: Several methods have recently been developed for joint structure learning
  of multiple (related) graphical models or networks. These methods treat individual
  networks as exchangeable, such that each pair of networks are equally encouraged
  to have similar structures. However, in many practical applications, exchangeability
  in this sense does not hold, as some pairs of networks may be more closely related
  than others, for example due to group and sub-group structures in the data. Here
  we present a novel Bayesian formulation that generalises joint structure learning
  beyond the exchangeable case. Moreover (i) a novel default prior over the joint
  structure space is proposed that requires no user input; (ii) latent networks are
  permitted; (iii) for time series data and dynamic Bayesian networks, an efficient,
  exact algorithm is provided. We present empirical results on non-exchangeable populations,
  including a real example from cancer biology, where cell-line specific networks
  are related according to known genomic features.
