title: "{Class Proportion Estimation with Application to Multiclass Anomaly Rejection}"
abstract: This work addresses two classification problems that fall under the heading
  of domain adaptation, wherein the distributions of training and testing examples
  differ. The first problem studied is that of class proportion estimation, which
  is the problem of estimating the class proportions in an unlabeled testing data
  set given labeled examples of each class. Compared to previous work on this problem,
  our approach has the novel feature that it does not require labeled training data
  from one of the classes. This property allows us to address the second domain adaptation
  problem, namely, multiclass anomaly rejection. Here, the goal is to design a classifier
  that has the option of assigning a “reject” label, indicating that the instance
  did not arise from a class present in the training data. We establish consistent
  learning strategies for both of these domain adaptation problems, which to our knowledge
  are the first of their kind. We also implement the class proportion estimation technique
  and demonstrate its performance on several benchmark data sets.
