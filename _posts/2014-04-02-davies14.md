title: Sparse Bayesian Variable Selection for the Identification of Antigenic Variability
  in the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus
abstract: Vaccines created from closely related viruses are vital for offering protection
  against newly emerging strains. For Foot-and-Mouth disease virus (FMDV), where multiple
  serotypes co-circulate, testing large numbers of vaccines can be infeasible. Therefore
  the development of an in silico predictor of cross-protection between strains is
  important to help optimise vaccine choice. Here we describe a novel sparse Bayesian
  variable selection model using spike and slab priors which is able to predict antigenic
  variability and identify sites which are important for the neutralisation of the
  virus. We are able to identify multiple residues which are known to be key indicators
  of antigenic variability. Many of these were not identified previously using Frequentist
  mixed-effects models and still cannot be found when an L1 penalty is used. We further
  explore how the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposal method for the inclusion
  of variables can offer significant reductions in computational requirements, both
  for spike and slab priors in general, and our hierarchical Bayesian model in particular.
