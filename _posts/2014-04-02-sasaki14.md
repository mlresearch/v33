title: "{Estimating Dependency Structures for non-Gaussian Components with Linear
  and Energy Correlations}"
abstract: The statistical dependencies which independent component analysis (ICA)
  cannot remove often provide rich information beyond the ICA components. It would
  be very useful to estimate the dependency structure from data. However, most models
  have concentrated on higher-order correlations such as energy correlations, neglecting
  linear correlations. Linear correlations might be a strong and informative form
  of a dependency for some real data sets, but they are usually completely removed
  by ICA and related methods, and not analyzed at all. In this paper, we propose a
  probabilistic model of non-Gaussian components which are allowed to have both linear
  and energy correlations. The dependency structure of the components is explicitly
  parametrized by a parameter matrix, which defines an undirected graphical model
  over the latent components. Furthermore, the estimation of the parameter matrix
  is shown to be particularly simple because using score matching, the objective function
  is a quadratic form. Using artificial data, we demonstrate that the proposed method
  is able to estimate non-Gaussian components and their dependency structures, as
  it is designed to do. When applied to natural images and outputs of simulated complex
  cells in the primary visual cortex, novel dependencies between the estimated features
  are discovered.
