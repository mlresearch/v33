title: "{Tight Bounds for the Expected Risk of Linear Classifiers and PAC-Bayes Finite-Sample
  Guarantees}"
abstract: We analyze the expected risk of linear classifiers for a fixed weight vector
  in the “minimax” setting. That is, we analyze the worst-case risk among all data
  distributions with a given mean and covariance. We provide a simpler proof of the
  tight polynomial-tail bound for general random variables. For sub-Gaussian random
  variables, we derive a novel tight exponential-tail bound. We also provide new PAC-Bayes
  finite-sample guarantees when training data is available. Our “minimax” generalization
  bounds are dimensionality-independent and \mathcalO(\sqrt1/m) for m samples.
