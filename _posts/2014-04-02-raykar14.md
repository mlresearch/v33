title: "{Sequential crowdsourced labeling as an epsilon-greedy exploration in a Markov
  Decision Process}"
abstract: Crowdsourcing marketplaces are widely used for curating large annotated
  datasets by collecting labels from multiple annotators. In such scenarios one has
  to balance the tradeoff between the accuracy of the collected labels, the cost of
  acquiring these labels, and the time taken to finish the labeling task. With the
  goal of reducing the labeling cost, we introduce the notion of sequential crowdsourced
  labeling, where instead of asking for all the labels in one shot we acquire labels
  from annotators sequentially one at a time. We model it as an epsilon-greedy exploration
  in a Markov Decision Process with a Bayesian decision theoretic utility function
  that incorporates accuracy, cost and time. Experimental results confirm that the
  proposed sequential labeling procedure can achieve similar accuracy at roughly half
  the labeling cost and at any stage in the labeling process the algorithm achieves
  a higher accuracy compared to randomly asking for the next label.
