title: "{The Dependent Dirichlet Process Mixture of Objects for Detection-free Tracking
  and Object Modeling}"
abstract: This paper explores how to find, track, and learn models of arbitrary objects
  in a video without a predefined method for object detection.  We present a model
  that localizes objects via unsupervised tracking while learning a representation
  of each object, avoiding the need for pre-built detectors. Our model uses a dependent
  Dirichlet process mixture to capture the uncertainty in the number and appearance
  of objects and requires only spatial and color video data that can be efficiently
  extracted via frame differencing. We give two inference algorithms for use in both
  online and offline settings, and use them to perform accurate detection-free tracking
  on multiple real videos.  We demonstrate our method in difficult detection scenarios
  involving occlusions and appearance shifts, on videos containing a large number
  of objects, and on a recent human-tracking benchmark where we show performance comparable
  to state of the art detector-based methods.
