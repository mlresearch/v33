title: "{FuSSO: Functional Shrinkage and Selection Operator}"
abstract: We present the FuSSO, a functional analogue to the LASSO, that efficiently
  finds a sparse set of functional input covariates to regress a real-valued response
  against. The FuSSO does so in a semi-parametric fashion, making no parametric assumptions
  about the nature of input functional covariates and assuming a linear form to the
  mapping of functional covariates to the response. We provide a statistical backing
  for use of the FuSSO via proof of asymptotic sparsistency under various conditions.
  Furthermore, we observe good results on both synthetic and real-world data.
