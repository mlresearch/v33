title: "{Bayesian Logistic Gaussian Process Models for Dynamic Networks}"
abstract: Time-varying adjacency matrices encoding the presence or absence of a relation
  among entities are available in many research fields. Motivated by an application
  to studying dynamic networks among sports teams, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric
  model.  The proposed approach uses a logistic mapping from the probability matrix,
  encoding link probabilities between each team, to an embedded latent relational
  space.  Within this latent space, we incorporate a dictionary of Gaussian process
  (GP) latent trajectories characterizing changes over time in each team, while allowing
  learning of the number of latent dimensions through a specially tailored prior for
  the GP covariance.  The model is provably flexible and borrows strength across the
  network and over time. We provide simulation experiments and an application to the
  Italian soccer Championship.
