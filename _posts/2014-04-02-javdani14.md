title: Near Optimal Bayesian Active Learning for Decision Making
abstract: 'How should we gather information to make effective decisions? We address
  Bayesian active learning and experimental design problems, where we sequentially
  select tests to reduce uncertainty about a set of hypotheses. Instead of minimizing
  uncertainty per se, we consider a set of overlapping decision regions of these hypotheses.
  Our goal is to drive uncertainty into a single decision region as quickly as possible.     We
  identify necessary and sufficient conditions for correctly identifying a decision
  region that contains all hypotheses consistent with observations. We develop a novel
  Hyperedge Cutting (HEC) algorithm for this problem, and prove that is competitive
  with the intractable optimal policy. Our efficient implementation of the algorithm
  relies on computing subsets of the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials. Finally,
  we demonstrate its effectiveness on two practical applications: approximate comparison-based
  learning and active localization using a robot manipulator.'
