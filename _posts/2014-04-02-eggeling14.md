title: "{Robust learning of inhomogeneous PMMs}"
abstract: Inhomogeneous parsimonious Markov models have recently been introduced for
  modeling symbolic sequences, with a main application being DNA sequence analysis.  Structure
  and parameter learning of these models has been proposed using a Bayesian approach,
  which entails the practically challenging choice of the prior distribution.  Cross
  validation is a possible way of tuning the prior hyperparameters towards a specific
  task such as prediction or classification, but it is overly time-consuming.  On
  this account, robust learning methods, which do not require explicit prior specification
  and – in the absence of prior knowledge – no hyperparameter tuning, are of interest.  In
  this work, we empirically investigate the performance of robust alternatives for
  structure and parameter learning that extend the practical applicability of inhomogeneous
  parsimonious Markov models to more complex settings than before.
