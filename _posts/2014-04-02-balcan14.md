title: "{A New Perspective on Learning Linear Separators with Large $L_qL_p$ Margins}"
abstract: We give theoretical and empirical results that provide new insights into
  large margin learning. We prove a bound on the generalization error of learning
  linear separators with large L_qL_p margins (where L_q and L_p are dual norms) for
  any finite p \ge 1. The bound leads to a simple data-dependent sufficient condition
  for fast learning in addition to extending and improving upon previous results.
  We also provide the first study that shows the benefits of taking advantage of margins
  with p < 2 over margins with p \ge 2. Our experiments confirm that our theoretical
  results are relevant in practice.
