title: Learning Heterogeneous Hidden Markov Random Fields
abstract: Hidden Markov random fields (HMRFs) are conventionally assumed to be homogeneous
  in the sense that the potential functions are invariant across different sites.
  However in some biological applications, it is desirable to make HMRFs heterogeneous,
  especially when there exists some background knowledge about how the potential functions
  vary. We formally define heterogeneous HMRFs and propose an EM algorithm whose M-step
  combines a contrastive divergence learner with a kernel smoothing step to incorporate
  the background knowledge. Simulations show that our algorithm is effective for learning
  heterogeneous HMRFs and outperforms alternative binning methods. We learn a heterogeneous
  HMRF in a real-world study.
