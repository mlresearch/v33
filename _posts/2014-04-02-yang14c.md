title: "{Nonparametric estimation and testing of exchangeable graph models}"
abstract: Exchangeable graph models (ExGM) are a nonparametric approach to modeling
  network data that subsumes a number of popular models. The key object that defines
  an ExGM is often referred to as a graphon, or graph kernel. Here, we make three
  contributions to advance the theory of estimation of graphons. We determine conditions
  under which a unique canonical representation for a graphon exists and it is identifiable.
  We propose a 3-step procedure to estimate the canonical graphon of any ExGM that
  satisfies these conditions. We then focus on a specific estimator, built using the
  proposed 3-step procedure, which combines probability matrix estimation by Universal
  Singular Value Thresholding (USVT) and empirical degree sorting of the observed
  adjacency matrix. We prove that this estimator is consistent. We illustrate how
  the proposed theory and methods can be used to develop hypothesis testing procedures
  for models of network data.
