title: 'SMERED: A Bayesian Approach to Graphical Record Linkage and De-duplication'
abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised approach for linking records across arbitrarily
  many files, while simultaneously detecting duplicate records within files.  Our
  key innovation is to represent the pattern of links between records as a bipartite
  graph, in which records are directly linked to latent true individuals, and only
  indirectly linked to other records.  This flexible new representation of the linkage
  structure naturally allows us to estimate the attributes of the unique observable
  people in the population, calculate k-way posterior probabilities of matches across
  records, and propagate the uncertainty of record linkage into later analyses. Our
  linkage structure lends itself to an efficient, linear-time, hybrid Markov chain  Monte
  Carlo algorithm, which overcomes many obstacles encountered by previously proposed
  methods of record linkage, despite the high dimensional parameter space. We assess
  our results on real and simulated data.
