title: Selective Sampling with Drift
abstract: Recently there has been much work on selective sampling, an online active
  learning setting, in which algorithms work in rounds. On each round an algorithm
  receives an input and makes a prediction. Then, it can decide whether to query a
  label, and if so to update its model, otherwise the input is discarded. Most of
  this work is focused on the stationary case, where it is assumed that there is a
  fixed target model, and the performance of the algorithm is compared to a fixed
  model. However, in many real-world applications, such as spam prediction, the best
  target function may drift over time, or have shifts from time to time. We develop
  a novel selective sampling algorithm for the drifting setting, analyze it under
  no assumptions on the mechanism generating the sequence of instances, and derive
  new mistake bounds that depend on the amount of drift in the problem. Simulations
  on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms
  as a selective sampling algorithm in the drifting setting.
