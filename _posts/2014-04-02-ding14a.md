title: "{Efficient Distributed Topic Modeling with Provable Guarantees}"
abstract: Topic modeling for large-scale distributed web-collections requires distributed
  techniques that account for both computational and communication costs. We consider
  topic modeling under the separability assumption and develop novel computationally
  efficient methods that provably achieve the statistical performance of the state-of-the-art
  centralized approaches while requiring insignificant communication between the distributed
  document collections. We achieve tradeoffs between communication and computation
  without actually transmitting the documents. Our scheme is based on exploiting the
  geometry of normalized word-word co-occurrence matrix and viewing each row of this
  matrix as a vector in a high-dimensional space. We relate the solid angle subtended
  by extreme points of the convex hull of these vectors to topic identities and construct
  distributed schemes to identify topics.
