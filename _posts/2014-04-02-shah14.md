title: "{Student-t Processes as Alternatives to Gaussian Processes}"
abstract: We investigate the Student-t process as an alternative to the Gaussian process
  as a nonparametric prior over functions. We derive closed form expressions for the
  marginal likelihood and predictive distribution of a Student-t process, by integrating
  away an inverse Wishart process prior over the covariance kernel of a Gaussian process
  model.  We show surprising equivalences between different hierarchical Gaussian
  process models leading to Student-t processes, and derive a new sampling scheme
  for the inverse Wishart process, which helps elucidate these equivalences. Overall,
  we show that a Student-t process can retain the attractive properties of a Gaussian
  process – a nonparametric representation, analytic marginal and predictive distributions,
  and easy model selection through covariance kernels – but has enhanced flexibility,
  and a predictive covariance that, unlike a Gaussian process, explicitly depends
  on the values of training observations.  We verify empirically that a Student-t
  process is especially useful in situations where there are changes in covariance
  structure, or in applications like Bayesian optimization, where accurate predictive
  covariances are critical for good performance. These advantages come at no additional
  computational cost over Gaussian processes.
