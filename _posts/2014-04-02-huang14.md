title: "{A Finite-Sample Generalization Bound for Semiparametric Regression: Partially
  Linear Models}"
abstract: In this paper we provide generalization bounds for semiparametric regression
  with the so-called partially linear models where the regression function is written
  as the sum of a linear parametric and a nonlinear, nonparametric function, the latter
  taken from a some set \mathcalH with finite entropy-integral. The problem is technically
  challenging because the parametric part is unconstrained and the model is underdetermined,
  while the response is allowed to be unbounded with subgaussian tails. Under natural
  regularity conditions, we bound the generalization error as a function of the metric
  entropy of \mathcalH and the dimension of the linear model. Our main tool is a ratio-type
  concentration inequality for increments of empirical processes, based on which we
  are able to give an exponential tail bound on the size of the parametric component.
  We also provide a comparison to alternatives of this technique and discuss why and
  when the unconstrained parametric part in the model may cause a problem in terms
  of the expected risk. We also explain by means of a specific example why this problem
  cannot be detected using the results of classical asymptotic analysis often seen
  in the statistics literature.
