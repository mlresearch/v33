title: "{A Non-parametric Conditional Factor Regression Model for Multi-Dimensional
  Input and Response}"
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a  non-parametric conditional factor regression
  (NCFR) model for domains with multi-dimensional input and response. NCFR enhances
  linear regression in two ways: a) introducing low-dimensional latent factors leading
  to dimensionality reduction and b) integrating the Indian Buffet Process as prior
  for the latent layer to dynamically derive an optimal number of sparse factors.
  Thanks to IBPâ€™s enhancements to the latent factors, NCFR can significantly avoid
  over-fitting even in the case of a very small sample size compared to the dimensionality.
  Experimental results on three diverse datasets comparing NCRF to a few baseline
  alternatives give evidence of its robust learning, remarkable predictive performance,
  good mixing and computational efficiency.'
