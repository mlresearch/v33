title: "{Decontamination of Mutually Contaminated Models}"
abstract: A variety of machine learning problems are characterized by   data sets
  that are drawn from multiple different convex   combinations of a fixed set of base
  distributions.  We call this a mutual contamination model.  In such problems, it
  is often of interest to   recover these base distributions, or otherwise discern   their
  properties. This work focuses on the problem of   classification with multiclass
  label noise, in a general   setting where the noise proportions are unknown and
  the   true class distributions are nonseparable and potentially   quite complex.
  We develop a procedure for decontamination   of the contaminated models from data,
  which then   facilitates the design of a consistent discrimination rule. Our   approach
  relies on a novel method for estimating the error   when projecting one distribution
  onto a convex combination   of others, where the projection is with respect to an   information
  divergence known as the separation distance.   Under sufficient conditions on the
  amount of noise and   purity of the base distributions, this projection procedure   successfully
  recovers the underlying class distributions. Connections to   novelty detection,
  topic modeling, and other learning problems are also   discussed.
