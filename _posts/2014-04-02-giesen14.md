title: "{Sketching the Support of a Probability Measure}"
abstract: We want to sketch the support of a probability measure on Euclidean    space
  from samples that have been drawn from the measure. This    problem is closely related
  to certain manifold learning problems,    where one assumes that the sample points
  are drawn from a manifold    that is embedded in Euclidean space. Here we propose
  to sketch the    support of the probability measure (that does not need to be a    manifold)
  by some gradient flow complex, or more precisely by its    Hasse diagram. The gradient
  flow is defined with respect to the    distance function to the sample points. We
  prove that a gradient    flow complex (that can be computed) is homotopy equivalent
  to the    support of the measure for sufficiently dense samplings, and    demonstrate
  the feasibility of our approach on real world data sets.
