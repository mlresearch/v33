title: "{On the Testability of Models with Missing Data}"
abstract: Graphical models that depict the process by which data are lost are helpful
  in recovering information from missing data. We address the question of whether
  any such model can be submitted to a statistical test given that the data available
  are corrupted by missingness. We present sufficient conditions for testability in
  missing data applications and note the impediments for testability when data are
  contaminated by missing entries. Our results strengthen the available tests for
  MCAR and MAR and further provide tests in the category of MNAR. Furthermore, we
  provide sufficient conditions to detect the existence of dependence between a variable
  and its missingness mechanism. We use our results to show that model sensitivity
  persists in    almost all models typically categorized as MNAR.
