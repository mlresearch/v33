title: Fast Distribution To Real Regression
abstract: 'We study the problem of distribution to real regression, where one aims
  to regress a mapping f that takes in a distribution input covariate P∈\mathcalI
  (for a non-parametric family of distributions \mathcalI) and outputs a real-valued
  response Y=f(P) + ε.   This setting was recently studied in Pózcos et al. (2013),
  where the “Kernel-Kernel” estimator was introduced and shown to have a polynomial
  rate of convergence.   However, evaluating a new prediction with the Kernel-Kernel
  estimator scales as Ω(N). This causes the difficult situation where a large amount
  of data may be necessary for a low estimation risk, but the computation cost of
  estimation becomes infeasible when the data-set is too large. To this end, we propose
  the Double-Basis estimator, which looks to alleviate this big data problem in two
  ways: first, the Double-Basis estimator is shown to have a computation complexity
  that is independent of the number of of instances N when evaluating new predictions
  after training; secondly, the Double-Basis estimator is shown to have a fast rate
  of convergence for a general class of mappings f∈\mathcalF.'
