title: A Gaussian Latent Variable Model for Large Margin Classification of Labeled
  and Unlabeled Data
abstract: We investigate a Gaussian latent variable model for semi-supervised learning
  of linear large margin classifiers.  The model’s latent variables encode the signed
  distance of examples to the separating hyperplane, and we constrain these variables,
  for both labeled and unlabeled examples, to ensure that the classes are separated
  by a large margin.  Our approach is based on similar intuitions as semi-supervised
  support vector machines (S3VMs), but these intuitions are formalized in a probabilistic
  framework.  Within this framework we are able to derive an especially simple Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) algorithm for learning.  The algorithm alternates between applying Bayes rule
  to “fill in” the latent variables (the E-step) and performing an unconstrained least-squares
  regression to update the weight vector (the M-step).  For the best results it is
  necessary to constrain the unlabeled data to have a similar ratio of positive to
  negative examples as the labeled data.  Within our model this constraint renders
  exact inference intractable, but we show that a Lyapunov central limit theorem (for
  sums of independent, but non-identical random variables) provides an excellent approximation
  to the true posterior distribution.  We perform experiments on large-scale text
  classification and find that our model significantly outperforms existing implementations
  of S3VMs.
