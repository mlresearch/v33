title: An inclusion optimal algorithm for chain graph structure learning
abstract: This paper presents and proves an extension of Meek’s conjecture to chain
  graphs under the Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg interpretation. The proof of the conjecture
  leads to the development of a structure learning algorithm that finds an inclusion
  optimal chain graph for any given probability distribution satisfying the composition
  property. Finally, the new algorithm is experimentally evaluated.
