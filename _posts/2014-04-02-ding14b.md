title: Pan-sharpening with a Bayesian nonparametric dictionary learning model
abstract: Pan-sharpening, a method for constructing high resolution images from low
  resolution observations, has recently been explored from the perspective of compressed
  sensing and sparse representation theory. We present a new pan-sharpening algorithm
  that uses a Bayesian nonparametric dictionary learning model to give an underlying
  sparse representation for image reconstruction. In contrast to existing dictionary
  learning methods, the proposed method infers parameters such as dictionary size,
  patch sparsity and noise variances. In addition, our regularization includes image
  constraints such as a total variation penalization term and a new gradient penalization
  on the reconstructed PAN image. Our method does not require high resolution multiband
  images for dictionary learning, which are unavailable in practice, but rather the
  dictionary is learned directly on the reconstructed image as part of the inversion
  process. We present experiments on several images to validate our method and compare
  with several other well-known approaches.
