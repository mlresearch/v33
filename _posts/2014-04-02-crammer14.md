title: Doubly Aggressive Selective Sampling Algorithms for Classification
abstract: Online selective sampling algorithms learn to perform binary    classification,
  and additionally they decided whether to ask, or    query, for a label of any given
  example. We introduce two stochastic    linear algorithms and analyze them in the
  worst-case mistake-bound    framework. Even though stochastic, for some inputs,
  our algorithms    query with probability 1 and make an update even if there is    no
  mistake, yet the margin is small, hence they are doubly      aggressive. We prove
  bounds in the worst-case settings, which    may be lower than previous bounds in
  some settings. Experiments with    33 document classification datasets, some with
  100Ks examples,    show the superiority of doubly-aggressive algorithms both in    performance
  and number of queries.
