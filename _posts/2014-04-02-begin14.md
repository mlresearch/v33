title: PAC-Bayesian Theory for Transductive Learning
abstract: We propose a PAC-Bayesian analysis of the transductive learning setting,
  introduced by Vapnik [2008], by proposing a family of new bounds on the generalization
  error. Some of them are derived from their counterpart in the inductive setting,
  and others are new. We also compare their behavior.
