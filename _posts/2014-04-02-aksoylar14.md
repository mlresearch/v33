title: "{Information-Theoretic Characterization of Sparse Recovery}"
abstract: We formulate sparse support recovery as a salient set identification problem
  and use information-theoretic analyses to characterize the recovery performance
  and sample complexity. We consider a very general framework where we are not restricted
  to linear models or specific distributions. We state non-asymptotic bounds on recovery
  probability and a tight mutual information formula for sample complexity. We evaluate
  our bounds for applications such as sparse linear regression and explicitly characterize
  effects of correlation or noisy features on recovery performance. We show improvements
  upon previous work and identify gaps between the performance of recovery algorithms
  and fundamental information. This illustrates a trade-off between computational
  complexity and sample complexity, contrasting the recovery of the support as a discrete
  object with signal estimation approaches.
