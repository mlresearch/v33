title: "{Learning Bounded Tree-width Bayesian Networks using Integer Linear Programming}"
abstract: In many applications one wants to compute conditional probabilities given
  a Bayesian network. This inference problem is NP-hard in general but becomes tractable
  when the network has low tree-width. Since the inference problem is common in many
  application areas, we provide a practical algorithm for learning bounded tree-width
  Bayesian networks. We cast this problem  as an integer linear program (ILP). The
  program can be solved by an anytime algorithm which provides upper bounds to assess
  the quality of the found solutions.  A key component of our program is a novel integer
  linear formulation for bounding tree-width of a graph. Our tests clearly indicate
  that our approach works in practice, as our implementation was able to find an optimal
  or nearly optimal network for most of the data sets.
