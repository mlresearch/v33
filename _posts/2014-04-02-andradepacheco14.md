title: Hybrid Discriminative-Generative Approach with Gaussian Processes
abstract: Machine learning practitioners are often faced with a choice between a discriminative
  and a generative approach to modelling. Here, we present a model based on a hybrid
  approach that breaks down some of the barriers between the discriminative and generative
  points of view, allowing continuous dimensionality reduction of hybrid discrete-continuous
  data, discriminative classification with missing inputs and manifold learning informed
  by class labels.
