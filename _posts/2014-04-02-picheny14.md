title: "{A Stepwise uncertainty reduction approach to constrained global optimization}"
abstract: Using statistical emulators to guide sequential evaluations of complex computer
  experiments is now  a well-established practice. When a model provides multiple
  outputs, a typical objective is to optimize one of the outputs   with constraints
  (for instance, a threshold not to exceed) on the values of the other outputs.   We
  propose here a new optimization strategy based on the stepwise uncertainty reduction
  paradigm,   which offers an efficient trade-off between exploration and local search
  near the boundaries.  The strategy is illustrated on numerical examples.
