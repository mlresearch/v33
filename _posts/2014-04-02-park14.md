title: "{LAMORE: A Stable, Scalable Approach to Latent Vector Autoregressive Modeling
  of Categorical Time Series}"
abstract: Latent vector autoregressive models for categorical time series have a wide
  range of potential applications from marketing research to healthcare analytics.
  However, a brute-force particle filter implementation of the Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) algorithm often fails to estimate the maximum likelihood parameters due to
  the Monte Carlo approximation of the E-step and multiple local optima of the log-likelihood
  function. This paper proposes two auxiliary techniques that help stabilize and calibrate
  the estimated parameters. These two techniques, namely \textitasymptotic mean regularization
  and \textitlow-resolution augmentation, do not require any additional parameter
  tuning, and can be implemented by modifying the brute-force EM algorithm. Experiments
  with simulated data show that the proposed techniques effectively stabilize the
  parameter estimation process. Also, experimental results using Medicare and MIMIC-II
  datasets illustrate various potential applications of the proposed model and methods.
