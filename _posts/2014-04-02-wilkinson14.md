title: Accelerating ABC methods using Gaussian processes
abstract: Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)  methods are used to approximate  posterior
  distributions  using simulation rather than likelihood calculations. We introduce
  Gaussian process (GP) accelerated ABC, which we show can significantly reduce the
  number of simulations required. As  computational resource is usually the main determinant
  of accuracy in ABC, GP-accelerated methods can thus enable  more accurate inference
  in some models.  GP models of the unknown log-likelihood function are  used to exploit
  continuity and smoothness,  reducing the required computation. We use a sequence
  of models  that increase in accuracy, using intermediate models to rule out regions
  of the parameter space as implausible. The methods will not be suitable for all
  problems, but when they can be used, can result in significant computational savings.
  For the Ricker model, we are able to achieve accurate approximations to the posterior
  distribution using a factor of 100 fewer simulator evaluations than comparable Monte
  Carlo approaches, and for a population genetics model we are able to approximate
  the exact posterior for the first time.
