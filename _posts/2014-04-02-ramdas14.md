title: An Analysis of Active Learning with Uniform Feature Noise
abstract: In active learning, the user sequentially chooses values for feature X and
  an oracle returns the corresponding label Y. In this paper, we consider the effect
  of feature noise in active learning, which could arise either because X itself is
  being measured, or it is corrupted in transmission to the oracle, or the oracle
  returns the label of a noisy version of the query point. In statistics, feature
  noise is known as“errors in variables” and has been studied extensively in non-active
  settings. However, the effect of feature noise in active learning has not been studied
  before. We consider the well-known Berkson errors-in-variables model with additive
  uniform noise of width σ.    Our simple but revealing setting is that of one-dimensional
  binary classification setting where the goal is to learn a threshold (point where
  the probability of a + label crosses half). We deal with regression functions that
  are antisymmetric in a region of size σaround the threshold and also satisfy Tsybakov’s
  margin condition around the threshold. We prove minimax lower and upper bounds which
  demonstrate that when σis smaller than the minimiax active/passive noiseless error
  derived in Castro & Nowak (2007), then noise has no effect on the rates and one
  achieves the same noiseless rates. For larger σ, the \textitunflattening of the
  regression function on convolution with uniform noise, along with its local antisymmetry
  around the threshold, together yield a behaviour where noise \textitappears to be
  beneficial. Our key result is that active learning can buy significant improvement
  over a passive strategy even in the presence of feature noise.
