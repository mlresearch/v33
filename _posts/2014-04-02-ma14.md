title: Active Area Search via Bayesian Quadrature
abstract: The selection of data collection locations is a problem that has received
  significant research attention from classical design of experiments to various recent
  active learning algorithms.  Typical objectives are to map an unknown function,
  optimize it, or find level sets in it.  Each of these objectives focuses on an assessment
  of individual points.  The introduction of set kernels has led to algorithms that
  instead consider labels assigned to sets of data points.  In this paper we combine
  these two concepts and consider the problem of choosing data collection locations
  when the goal is to identify regions whose set of collected data would be labeled
  positively by a set classifier.  We present an algorithm for the case where the
  positive class is defined in terms of a regionâ€™s average function value being above
  some threshold with high probability, a problem we call active area search. To this
  end, we model the latent function using a Gaussian process and use Bayesian quadrature
  to estimate its integral on predefined regions.  Our method is the first which directly
  solves the active area search problem.  In experiments it outperforms previous algorithms
  that were developed for other active search goals.
