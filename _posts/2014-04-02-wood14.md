title: "{A New Approach to Probabilistic Programming Inference}"
abstract: We introduce and demonstrate a new approach to inference in expressive probabilistic
  programming languages based on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo. Our approach is
  easy to implement and to parallelize, applies to Turing-complete probabilistic programming
  languages, and supports accurate inference in models that make use of complex control
  flow, including stochastic recursion, as well as primitives from nonparametric Bayesian
  statistics. Our experiments show that this approach can be more efficient than previously
  introduced single-site Metropolis-Hastings samplers.
