title: "{Learning Optimal Bounded Treewidth Bayesian Networks via Maximum Satisfiability}"
abstract: Bayesian network structure learning is the well-known computationally hard
  problem of finding a directed acyclic graph structure that optimally describes given
  data. A learned structure can then be used for probabilistic inference. While exact
  inference in Bayesian networks is in general NP-hard, it is tractable in networks
  with low treewidth. This provides good motivations for developing algorithms for
  the NP-hard problem of learning optimal bounded treewidth Bayesian networks (BTW-BNSL).
  In this work, we develop a novel score-based approach to BTW-BNSL, based on casting
  BTW-BNSL as weighted partial Maximum satisfiability. We demonstrate empirically
  that the approach scales notably better than a recent exact dynamic programming
  algorithm for BTW-BNSL.
