title: 'Visual Boundary Prediction:  A Deep Neural Prediction Network and Quality
  Dissection'
abstract: This paper investigates visual boundary detection, i.e. prediction   of
  the presence of a boundary at a given image location. We develop a   novel neurally-inspired
  deep architecture for the task. Notable   aspects of our work are (i) the use of
  “covariance features”  [Ranzato and Hinton, 2010] which depend on the \emphsquared
  response   of a filter to the input image, and (ii) the integration of image   information
  from multiple scales and semantic levels via multiple   streams of interlinked,
  layered, and non-linear “deep”   processing. Our results on the Berkeley Segmentation
  Data Set   500 (BSDS500) show comparable or better performance to the   top-performing
  methods  [Arbelaez et al., 2011, Ren and Bo, 2012, Lim et al., 2013, Dollár  and
  Zitnick, 2013]  with effective inference times. We also propose novel quantitative
  assessment techniques for improved method understanding and comparison. We  carefully
  dissect the performance of our architecture,  feature-types used and training methods,
  providing clear signals for model understanding and development.
