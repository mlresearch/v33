title: Gaussian Copula Precision Estimation with Missing Values
abstract: 'We consider the problem of estimating sparse precision matrix of Gaussian
  copula distributions using samples with missing values in high dimensions.  Existing
  approaches, primarily designed for Gaussian distributions, suggest using plugin
  estimators by disregarding the missing values.  In this paper, we propose double
  plugin Gaussian (DoPinG) copula estimators to estimate the sparse precision matrix
  corresponding to \emphnon-paranormal distributions.  DoPinG uses two plugin procedures
  and consists of three steps: (1) estimate nonparametric correlations based on observed
  values,  including Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho; (2) estimate the non-paranormal
  correlation matrix; (3) plug into existing sparse precision estimators.   We prove
  that DoPinG copula estimators consistently estimate the non-paranormal correlation
  matrix at a rate of O(\frac1(1-δ)\sqrt\frac\log pn), where δis the probability of
  missing values.   We provide experimental results to illustrate the effect of sample
  size and percentage of missing data on the model performance. Experimental results
  show that DoPinG is significantly better than estimators like mGlasso, which are
  primarily designed for Gaussian data.'
