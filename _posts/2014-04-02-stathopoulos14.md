title: Bat Call Identification with Gaussian Process Multinomial Probit Regression
  and a Dynamic Time Warping Kernel
abstract: We study the problem of identifying bat species from echolocation calls
  in order to build automated bioacoustic monitoring algorithms. We employ the Dynamic
  Time Warping algorithm which has been successfully applied for bird flight calls
  identification and show that classification performance is superior to hand crafted
  call shape parameters used in previous research. This highlights that generic bioacoustic
  software with good classification rates can be constructed with little domain knowledge.
  We conduct a study with field data of 21 bat species from the north and central
  Mexico using a multinomial probit regression model with Gaussian process prior and
  a full EP approximation of the posterior of latent function values. Results indicate
  high classification accuracy across almost all classes while misclassification rate
  across families of species is low highlighting the common evolutionary path of echolocation
  in bats.
