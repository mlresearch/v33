title: "{Expectation Propagation for Likelihoods Depending on an Inner Product of
  Two Multivariate Random Variables}"
abstract: We describe how a deterministic Gaussian posterior approximation can be
  constructed using expectation propagation (EP) for models, where the likelihood
  function depends on an inner product of two multivariate random variables. The family
  of applicable models includes a wide variety of important linear latent variable
  models used in statistical machine learning, such as principal component and factor
  analysis, their linear extensions, and errors-in-variables regression. The EP computations
  are facilitated by an integral transformation of the Dirac delta function, which
  allows transforming the multidimensional integrals over the two multivariate random
  variables into an analytically tractable form up to one-dimensional analytically
  intractable integrals that can be efficiently computed numerically. We study the
  resulting posterior approximations in sparse principal component analysis with Gaussian
  and probit likelihoods. Comparisons to Gibbs sampling and variational inference
  are presented.
