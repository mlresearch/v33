title: "{Analysis of Empirical MAP and Empirical Partially Bayes: Can They be Alternatives
  to Variational Bayes?}"
abstract: Variational Bayesian (VB) learning is known to be a   promising   approximation
  to Bayesian learning  with computational efficiency.  However, in some applications,  e.g.,
  large-scale collaborative filtering and tensor factorization,  VB is still computationally
  too costly.  In such cases,   looser approximations  such as MAP estimation and
  partially Bayesian (PB) learning,  where a part of the parameters are point-estimated,  seem
  attractive.  In this paper,   we theoretically investigate the behavior of the MAP
  and the PB solutions of matrix factorization.  A notable finding is that the global
  solutions of MAP and PB in the empirical Bayesian scenario,  where the hyperparameters
  are also estimated from observation,  are trivial and useless,  while  their local
  solutions behave similarly to the global solution of VB.  This suggests that empirical
  MAP and empirical PB with local search can be alternatives to empirical VB  equipped
  with the useful automatic relevance determination property.  Experiments support
  our theory.
