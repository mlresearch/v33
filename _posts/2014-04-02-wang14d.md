title: "{Bayesian Multi-Scale Optimistic Optimization}"
abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful global optimization technique for expensive
  black-box functions. One of its shortcomings is that it requires auxiliary optimization
  of an acquisition function at each iteration. This auxiliary optimization can be
  costly and very hard to carry out in practice. Moreover, it creates serious theoretical
  concerns, as most of the convergence results assume that the exact optimum of the
  acquisition function can be found. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for
  efficient global optimization that combines Gaussian process confidence bounds and
  treed simultaneous optimistic optimization to eliminate the need for auxiliary optimization
  of acquisition functions. The experiments with global optimization benchmarks, as
  well as a novel application to automate information extraction, demonstrate that
  the resulting technique is more efficient than the two approaches from which it
  draws inspiration. Unlike most theoretical analyses of Bayesian optimization with
  Gaussian processes, our convergence rate proofs do not require exact optimization
  of an acquisition function. That is, our approach eliminates the unsatisfactory
  assumption that a difficult, potentially NP-hard, problem has to be solved in order
  to obtain vanishing regret rates.
