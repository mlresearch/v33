title: Efficient Algorithms and Error Analysis for the Modified Nystrom Method
abstract: Many kernel methods suffer from high time and space complexities and are
  thus prohibitive in big-data applications. To tackle the computational challenge,
  the Nyström method has been extensively used to reduce time and space complexities
  by sacrificing some accuracy. The Nyström method speedups computation by constructing
  an approximation of the kernel matrix using only a few  columns of the matrix. Recently,
  a variant of the Nyström method called the modified Nyström method has demonstrated
  significant improvement over the standard Nyström method in approximation accuracy,
  both theoretically and empirically.      In this paper, we propose two algorithms
  that make the modified Nyström method practical. First, we devise a  simple column
  selection algorithm with a provable error bound. Our algorithm is more  efficient
  and easier to implement than and nearly as accurate as the state-of-the-art algorithm.
  Second, with the selected columns at hand, we propose an algorithm that computes
  the approximation in lower time complexity than the approach in the previous work.
  Furthermore, we prove that the modified Nyström method is exact under certain conditions,
  and we establish a lower error bound for the modified Nyström method.
