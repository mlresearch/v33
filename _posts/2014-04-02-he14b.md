title: Exploiting the Limits of Structure Learning via Inherent Symmetry
abstract: This theoretical paper is concerned with the structure learning limit for
  Gaussian Markov random fields from i.i.d. samples. The common strategy is applying
  the Fano method to a family of restricted ensembles. The efficiency of this method,
  however, depends crucially on selected restricted ensembles. To break through this
  limitation, we analyze the whole graph ensemble from high-dimensional geometric
  and group-theoretical perspectives. The key ingredients of our approach are the
  geometric property of concentration matrices and the invariance of orthogonal group
  actions on the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence. We then establish the connection
  of the learning limit and eigenvalues of concentration matrices, which leads to
  a sharper structure learning limit. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper
  to consider the structure learning problem via inherent symmetries of the whole
  ensemble. Finally, our approach can be applicable to other graphical structure learning
  problems.
