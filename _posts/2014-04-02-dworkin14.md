title: "{Efficient Inference for Complex Queries on Complex Distributions}"
abstract: We consider problems of approximate inference in which the query of interest
  is given by a complex formula (such as a formula in disjunctive formal form (DNF))
  over a joint distribution given by a graphical model. We give a general reduction
  showing that (approximate) marginal inference for a class of distributions yields
  approximate inference for DNF queries, and extend our techniques to accommodate
  even more complex queries, and dense graphical models with variational inference,
  under certain conditions. Our results unify and generalize classical inference techniques
  (which are generally restricted to simple marginal queries) and approximate counting
  methods such as those introduced by Karp, Luby and Madras (which are generally restricted
  to product distributions).
