title: Recovering Distributions from Gaussian RKHS Embeddings
abstract: Recent advances of kernel methods have yielded a framework for nonparametric
  statistical inference called RKHS embeddings, in which all probability distributions
  are represented as elements in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, namely kernel
  means. In this paper, we consider the recovery of the information of a distribution
  from an estimate of the kernel mean, when a Gaussian kernel is used. To this end,
  we theoretically analyze the properties of a consistent estimator of a kernel mean,
  which is represented as a weighted sum of feature vectors. First, we prove that
  the weighted average of a function in a Besov space, whose weights and samples are
  given by the kernel mean estimator, converges to the expectation of the function.
  As corollaries, we show that the moments and the probability measures on intervals
  can be recovered from an estimate of the kernel mean. We also prove that a consistent
  estimator of the density of a distribution can be defined using a kernel mean estimator.
  This result confirms that we can in fact completely recover the information of distributions
  from RKHS embeddings.
