title: Spoofing Large Probability Mass Functions to Improve Sampling Times and Reduce
  Memory Costs
abstract: Sampling from a probability mass function (PMF) has many applications in
  modern computing.  This paper presents a novel lossy compression method intended
  for large (O(10^5)) dense PMFs that speeds up the sampling process and guarantees
  high fidelity sampling.  This compression method closely approximates an input PMF
  P with another PMF Q that is easy to store and sample from.  All samples are drawn
  from Q as opposed to the original input distribution P.  We say that Q “spoofs”
  P while this switch is difficult to detect with a statistical test.  The lifetime
  of Q is the sample size required to detect the switch from P to Q.  We show how
  to compute a single PMF’s lifetime and present numeric examples demonstrating compression
  rates ranging from 62% to 75% when the input PMF is not sorted and 88% to 99% when
  the input is already sorted.  These examples have speed ups ranging from 1.47 to
  2.82 compared to binary search sampling.
