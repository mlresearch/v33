title: "{Black Box Variational Inference}"
abstract: Variational inference has become a widely used method to approximate posteriors
  in complex latent variables models.  However, deriving a variational inference algorithm
  generally requires significant model-specific analysis. These efforts can hinder
  and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a variety of models for a problem
  at hand.  In this paper, we present a “black box” variational inference algorithm,
  one that can be quickly applied to many models with little additional derivation.  Our
  method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where
  the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution.  We
  develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining
  the criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations.  We evaluate
  our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find that
  our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods.
  Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily explore
  a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating several models of
  longitudinal healthcare data.
