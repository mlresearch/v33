title: PAC-Bayesian Collective Stability
abstract: Recent results have shown that the generalization error of structured predictors
  decreases with both the number of examples and the size of each example, provided
  the data distribution has weak dependence and the predictor exhibits a smoothness
  property called collective stability. These results use an especially strong definition
  of collective stability that must hold uniformly over all inputs and all hypotheses
  in the class. We investigate whether weaker definitions of collective stability
  suffice. Using the PAC-Bayes framework, which is particularly amenable to our new
  definitions, we prove that generalization is indeed possible when uniform collective
  stability happens with high probability over draws of predictors (and inputs). We
  then derive a generalization bound for a class of structured predictors with variably
  convex inference, which suggests a novel learning objective that optimizes collective
  stability.
