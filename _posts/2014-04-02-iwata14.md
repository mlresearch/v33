title: "{Global Optimization Methods for Extended Fisher Discriminant Analysis}"
abstract: 'The Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is a common technique for binary
  classification. A parametrized extension, which we call the extended FDA, has been
  introduced from the viewpoint of robust optimization. In this work, we first give
  a new probabilistic interpretation of the extended FDA. We then develop algorithms
  for solving an optimization problem that arises from the extended FDA: computing
  the distance between a point and the surface of an ellipsoid. We solve this problem
  via the KKT points, which we show are obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue
  problem. We speed up the algorithm by taking advantage of the matrix structure and
  proving that a globally optimal solution is a KKT point with the smallest Lagrange
  multiplier, which can be computed efficiently as the leftmost eigenvalue. Numerical
  experiments illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the extended FDA model
  combined with our algorithm.'
