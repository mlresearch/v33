title: An LP for Sequential Learning Under Budgets
abstract: We present a convex framework to learn sequential decisions and apply this
  to the problem of learning under a budget. We consider the structure proposed [1],
  where sensor measurements are acquired in a sequence. The goal after acquiring each
  new measurement is to make a decision whether to stop and classify or to pay the
  cost of using the next sensor in the sequence. We introduce a novel formulation
  of an empirical risk objective for the multi stage sequential decision problem.
  This objective naturally lends itself to a non-convex multilinear formulation. Nevertheless,
  we derive a novel perspective that leads to a tight convex objective. This is accomplished
  by expressing the empirical risk in terms of linear superposition of indicator functions.
  We then derive an LP formulation by utilizing hinge loss surrogates. Our LP achieves
  or exceeds the empirical performance as the non-convex alternating algorithm that
  requires a large number of random initializations. Consequently, the LP has the
  advantage of guaranteed convergence, global optimality, repeatability and computation
  efficiency.
