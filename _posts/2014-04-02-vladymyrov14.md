title: Linear-time training of nonlinear low-dimensional embeddings
abstract: Nonlinear embeddings such as stochastic neighbor embedding or the elastic
  embedding achieve better results than spectral methods but require an expensive,
  nonconvex optimization, where the objective function and gradient are quadratic
  on the sample size. We address this bottleneck by formulating the optimization as
  an N-body problem and using fast multipole methods (FMMs) to approximate the gradient
  in linear time. We study the effect, in theory and experiment, of approximating
  gradients in the optimization and show that the expected error is related to the
  mean curvature of the objective function, and that gradually increasing the accuracy
  level in the FMM over iterations leads to a faster training. When combined with
  standard optimizers, such as gradient descent or L-BFGS, the resulting algorithm
  beats the \mathcalO(N \log N) Barnes-Hut method and achieves reasonable embeddings
  for one million points in around three hoursâ€™ runtime.
