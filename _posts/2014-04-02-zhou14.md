title: Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation for Multiple Classes
abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient Multi-class  Heterogeneous Domain
  Adaptation (HDA)  method, where data from the source and target domains are  represented
  by heterogeneous features with different dimensions.  Specifically, we propose to
  reconstruct a sparse feature  transformation matrix to map the features of multiple
  classes from  the source domain to the target domain. We  cast this  learning task
  as a compressed sensing problem, where each classifier  can be deemed as a measurement
  sensor. Based on compressive  sensing theory, the estimation error of the transformation
  matrix  decreases with the increasing number of classifiers. Therefore, to  guarantee
  the reconstruction performance, we construct  sufficiently many binary classifiers
  based on the error correcting output  correcting. Extensive experiments are conducted
  on  both toy data and three real-world HDA applications to verify the  superiority
  of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art  HDA methods in terms of prediction
  accuracy.
