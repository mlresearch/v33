title: "{Scaling Graph-based Semi Supervised Learning to Large Number of Labels Using
  Count-Min Sketch}"
abstract: Graph-based Semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successfully
  used in a large number of applications. These methods classify initially unlabeled
  nodes by propagating label information over the structure of graph starting from
  seed nodes. Graph-based SSL algorithms usually scale linearly with the number of
  distinct labels (m), and require O(m) space on each node. Unfortunately, there exist
  many applications of practical significance with very large m over large graphs,
  demanding better space and time complexity. In this paper, we propose MAD-Sketch,
  a novel graph-based SSL algorithm which compactly stores label distribution on each
  node using Count-min Sketch, a randomized data structure. We present theoretical
  analysis showing that under mild conditions, MAD-Sketch can reduce space complexity
  at each node from O(m) to O(\log(m)), and achieve similar savings in time complexity
  as well. We support our analysis through experiments on multiple real world datasets.
  We observe that MAD-Sketch achieves similar performance as existing state-of-the-art
  graph-based SSL algorithms, while requiring smaller memory footprint and at the
  same time achieving up to 10x speedup. We find that MAD-Sketch is able to scale
  to datasets with one million labels, which is beyond the scope of existing graph-based
  SSL algorithms.
