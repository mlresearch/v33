title: "{Generating Efficient MCMC Kernels from Probabilistic Programs}"
abstract: 'Universal probabilistic programming languages (such as Church) trade performance
  for abstraction: any model can be represented compactly as an arbitrary stochastic
  computation, but costly online analyses are required for inference. We present a
  technique that recovers hand-coded levels of performance from a universal probabilistic
  language, for the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) MCMC inference algorithm. It takes a
  Church program as input and traces its execution to remove computation overhead.
  It then analyzes the trace for each proposal, using slicing, to identify the minimal
  computation needed to evaluate the MH acceptance probability. Generated incremental
  code is much faster than a baseline implementation (up to 600x) and usually as fast
  as hand-coded MH kernels.'
