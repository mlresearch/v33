title: "{Towards building a Crowd-Sourced Sky Map}"
abstract: We describe a system that builds a high dynamic-range and wide-angle image
  of the night sky by combining a large set of input images.  The method makes use
  of pixel-rank information in the individual input images to improve a “consensus”
  pixel rank in the combined image.  Because it only makes use of ranks and the complexity
  of the algorithm is linear in the number of images, the method is useful for large
  sets of uncalibrated images that might have undergone unknown non-linear tone mapping
  transformations for visualization or aesthetic reasons.  We apply the method to
  images of the night sky (of unknown provenance) discovered on the Web.  The method
  permits discovery of astronomical objects or features that are not visible in any
  of the input images taken individually.  More importantly, however, it permits scientific
  exploitation of a huge source of astronomical images that would not be available
  to astronomical research without our automatic system.
