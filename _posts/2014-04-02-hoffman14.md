title: "{On correlation and budget constraints in model-based bandit optimization
  with application to automatic machine learning}"
abstract: We address the problem of finding the maximizer of a nonlinear function
  that can only be evaluated, subject to noise, at a finite number of query locations.
  Further, we will assume that there is a constraint on the total number of permitted
  function evaluations. We introduce a Bayesian approach for this problem and show
  that it empirically outperforms both the existing frequentist counterpart and other
  Bayesian optimization methods. The Bayesian approach places emphasis on detailed
  modelling, including the modelling of correlations among the arms. As a result,
  it can perform well in situations where the number of arms is much larger than the
  number of allowed function evaluation, whereas the frequentist counterpart is inapplicable.
  This feature enables us to develop and deploy practical applications, such as automatic
  machine learning toolboxes. The paper presents comprehensive comparisons of the
  proposed approach with many Bayesian and bandit optimization techniques, the first
  comparison of many of these methods in the literature.
