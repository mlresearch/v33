title: "{Connected Sub-graph Detection}"
abstract: We characterize the family of connected subgraphs in terms of linear matrix
  inequalities (LMI) with additional integrality constraints. We then show that convex
  relaxations of the integral LMI lead to parameterization of all weighted connected
  subgraphs. These developments allow for optimizing arbitrary graph functionals under
  connectivity constraints. For concreteness we consider the connected sub-graph detection
  problem that arises in a number of applications including network intrusion, disease
  outbreaks, and video surveillance. In these applications feature vectors are associated
  with nodes and edges of a graph. The problem is to decide whether or not the null
  hypothesis is true based on the measured features. For simplicity we consider the
  elevated mean problem wherein feature values at various nodes are distributed IID
  under the null hypothesis. The non-null (positive) hypothesis is distinguished from
  the null hypothesis by the fact that feature values on some unknown connected sub-graph
  has elevated mean.
