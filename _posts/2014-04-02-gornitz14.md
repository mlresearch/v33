title: "{Learning and Evaluation in Presence of Non-i.i.d. Label Noise}"
abstract: In many real-world applications, the simplified assumption of independent
  and identically distributed noise breaks down, and labels can have structured, systematic
  noise. For example, in brain-computer interface applications, training data is often
  the result of lengthy experimental sessions, where the attention levels of participants
  can change over the course of the experiment. In such application cases, structured
  label noise will cause problems because most machine learning methods assume independent
  and identically distributed label noise. In this paper, we present a novel methodology
  for learning and evaluation in presence of systematic label noise. The core of which
  is a novel extension of support vector data description / one-class SVM that can
  incorporate latent variables. Controlled simulations on synthetic data and a real-world
  EEG  experiment with 20 subjects from the domain of brain-computer-interfacing show
  that our method achieves accuracies that go beyond the state of the art.
