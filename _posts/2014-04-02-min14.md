title: "{Interpretable Sparse High-Order Boltzmann Machines}"
abstract: Fully-observable high-order Boltzmann Machines are capable of identifying
  explicit high-order feature interactions theoretically. However, they have never
  been used in practice due to their prohibitively high computational cost for inference
  and learning. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for learning a fully
  observable high-order Boltzmann Machine based on sparse learning and contrastive
  divergence, resulting in an interpretable Sparse High-order Boltzmann Machine, denoted
  as SHBM. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a real dataset demonstrate
  that SHBM can produce higher pseudo-log-likelihood and better reconstructions on
  test data than the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we apply SHBM to a challenging
  bioinformatics problem of discovering complex Transcription Factor interactions.
  Compared to conventional Boltzmann Machine and directed Bayesian Network, SHBM can
  identify much more biologically meaningful interactions that are supported by recent
  biological studies. To the best of our knowledge, SHBM is the first working Boltzmann
  Machine with explicit high-order feature interactions applied to real-world problems.
