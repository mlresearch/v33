title: Learning Structured Models with the AUC Loss and Its Generalizations
abstract: Many problems involve the prediction of multiple, possibly dependent labels.
  The structured output prediction framework builds predictors that take these dependencies
  into account and use them to improve accuracy. In many such tasks, performance is
  evaluated by the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). While a framework for optimizing
  the AUC loss for unstructured models exists, it does not naturally extend to structured
  models.    In this work, we propose a representation and learning formulation for
  optimizing structured models over the AUC loss, show how our approach generalizes
  the unstructured case, and provide algorithms for solving the resulting inference
  and learning problems. We also explore several new variants of the AUC measure which
  naturally arise from our formulation. Finally, we empirically show the utility of
  our approach in several domains.
