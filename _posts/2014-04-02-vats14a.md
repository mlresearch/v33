title: "{Path Thresholding: Asymptotically Tuning-Free High-Dimensional Sparse Regression}"
abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging problem of selecting tuning parameters
  for high-dimensional sparse regression.  We propose a simple and computationally
  efficient method, called path thresholding PaTh, that transforms any tuning parameter-dependent
  sparse regression algorithm into an asymptotically tuning-free sparse regression
  algorithm.  More specifically, we prove that, as the problem size becomes large
  (in the number of variables and in the number of observations), PaTh performs accurate
  sparse regression, under appropriate conditions, without specifying a tuning parameter.  In
  finite-dimensional settings, we demonstrate that PaTh can alleviate the computational
  burden of model selection algorithms by significantly reducing the search space
  of tuning parameters.
