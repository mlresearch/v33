title: "{Robust Forward Algorithms via PAC-Bayes and Laplace Distributions}"
abstract: Laplace random variables are commonly used  to model extreme noise in many
  fields, while  systems trained to deal with such noises are  often characterized
  by robustness properties.  We introduce new learning algorithms that  minimize objectives
  derived directly from  PAC-Bayes bounds, incorporating Laplace  distributions. The
  resulting algorithms are  regulated by the Huber loss function and  are robust to
  noise, as the Laplace distribution  integrated large deviation of parameters.  We
  analyze the convexity properties  of the objective, and propose a few bounds  which
  are fully convex, two of which jointly  convex in the mean and standard-deviation  under
  certain conditions. We derive new forward  algorithms analogous to recent boosting  algorithms,
  providing novel relations between  boosting and PAC-Bayes analysis. Experiments  show
  that our algorithms outperforms  AdaBoost, L1-LogBoost, and RobustBoost  in a wide
  range of input noise.
