title: "{Incremental Tree-Based Inference with Dependent Normalized Random Measures}"
abstract: Normalized random measures (NRMs) form a broad class of discrete random
  measures that are used as priors for Bayesian nonparametric models. Dependent normalized
  random measures (DNRMs) introduce dependencies in a set of NRMs, to facilitate the
  handling of data where the assumption of exchangeability is violated. Various methods
  have been developed to construct DNRMs; of particular interest is mixed normalized
  random measures (MNRMs), where DNRM is represented as a mixture of underlying shared
  normalized random measures. Emphasis in existing works is placed on the construction
  methods of DNRMs, but there is a little work on efficient inference for DNRMs. In
  this paper, we present a tree-based inference method for MNRM mixture models, extending
  Bayesian hierarchical clustering (BHC) which was originally developed as a deterministic
  approximate inference for Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models. We also present
  an incremental inference for MNRM mixture models, building a tree incrementally
  in the sense that the tree structure is partially updated whenever a new data point
  comes in. The tree, when constructed in such a way, allows us to efficiently perform
  tree-consistent MAP inference in MRNM mixture models, determining a most probable
  tree-consistent partition, as well as to compute a marginal likelihood approximately.
  Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
  usefulness of our algorithm, compared to MCMC methods.
