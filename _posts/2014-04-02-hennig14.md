title: "{Probabilistic Solutions to Differential Equations and their Application to
  Riemannian Statistics}"
abstract: We study a probabilistic numerical method for the solution of both boundary
  and initial value problems that returns a joint Gaussian process posterior over
  the solution. Such methods have concrete value in the statistics on Riemannian manifolds,
  where non-analytic ordinary differential equations are involved in virtually all
  computations. The probabilistic formulation permits marginalising the uncertainty
  of the numerical solution such that statistics are less sensitive to inaccuracies.
  This leads to new Riemannian algorithms for mean value computations and principal
  geodesic analysis. Marginalisation also means results can be less precise than point
  estimates, enabling a noticeable speed-up over the state of the art. Our approach
  is an argument for a wider point that uncertainty caused by numerical calculations
  should be tracked throughout the pipeline of machine learning algorithms.
