title: Average Case Analysis of High-Dimensional Block-Sparse Recovery and Regression
  for Arbitrary Designs
abstract: This paper studies conditions for high-dimensional inference when the set
  of observations is given by a linear combination of a small number of groups of
  columns of a design matrix, termed the “block-sparse” case. In this regard, it first
  specifies conditions on the design matrix under which most of its block submatrices
  are well conditioned. It then leverages this result for average-case analysis of
  high-dimensional block-sparse recovery and regression. In contrast to earlier works,
  the results of this paper are fundamentally different because (i) they provide conditions
  on arbitrary designs that can be explicitly computed in polynomial time, (ii) the
  provided conditions translate into near-optimal scaling of the number of observations
  with the number of active blocks of the design matrix, and (iii) they suggest that
  the spectral norm, rather than the column/block coherences, of the design matrix
  fundamentally limits the performance of computational methods in high-dimensional
  settings.
