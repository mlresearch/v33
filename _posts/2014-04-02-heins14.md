title: A Statistical Model for Event Sequence Data
abstract: The identification of recurring patterns within a sequence of events is
  an important task in behavior research. In this paper, we consider a general probabilistic
  framework for identifying such patterns, by distinguishing between events that belong
  to a pattern and events that occur as part of background processes. The event processes,
  both for background events and events that are part of recurring patterns, are modeled
  as competing renewal processes. Using this framework, we develop an inference procedure
  to detect the sequences present in observed data. Our method is compared to a current
  approach used within the ethology literature on both simulated data and data collected
  to study the impact of fragmented and unpredictable maternal behavior on cognitive
  development of children.
