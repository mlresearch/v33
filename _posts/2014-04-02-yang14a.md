title: Mixed Graphical Models via Exponential Families
abstract: Markov Random Fields, or undirected graphical models are widely used to
  model high-dimensional multivariate data. Classical instances of these models, such
  as Gaussian Graphical and Ising Models, as well as recent extensions to graphical
  models specified by univariate exponential families, assume all variables arise
  from the same distribution. Complex data from high-throughput genomics and social
  networking for example, often contain discrete, count, and continuous variables
  measured on the same set of samples. To model such heterogeneous data, we develop
  a \emphnovel class of mixed graphical models by specifying that each node-conditional
  distribution is a member of a possibly different univariate exponential family.
  We study several instances of our model, and propose scalable M-estimators for recovering
  the underlying network structure. Simulations as well as an application to learning
  mixed genomic networks from next generation sequencing and mutation data demonstrate
  the versatility of our methods.
