title: Context Aware Group Nearest Shrunken Centroids in Large-Scale Genomic Studies
abstract: Recent genomic studies have identified genes related to specific phenotypes.  In
  addition to marginal association analysis for individual genes, analyzing gene pathways
  (functionally related sets of genes) may yield additional valuable insights.  We
  have devised an approach to phenotype classification from gene expression profiling.  Our
  method named “group Nearest Shrunken Centroids (gNSC)” is an enhancement of the
  Nearest Shrunken Centroids (NSC) which is a popular and scalable method to analyze
  big data. While fully utilizing the variable structure of gene pathways, gNSC shares
  comparable computational speed as NSC if the group size is small.  Comparing with
  NSC, gNSC improves the power of classification by utilizing the gene pathway information.
  In practice, we investigate the performance of gNSC on one of the largest microarray
  datasets aggregated from the internet. We show the effectiveness of our method by
  comparing the misclassification rate of gNSC with that of NSC.  Additionally, we
  present a novel application of NSC/gNSC on context analysis of association between
  pathways  and certain medical words.  Some newest biological findings are rediscovered.
