title: On Estimating Causal Effects based on Supplemental Variables
abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating causal effects of a treatment
  on a response using supplementary variables.   Under the assumption that a treatment
  is associated with a response through a univariate supplementary variable in the
  framework of linear regression models, Cox (1960) showed that the estimation accuracy
  of the regression coefficient of the treatment on the response in the single linear
  regression model can be improved by using the recursive linear regression model
  based on the supplementary variable from the viewpoint of the asymptotic variance.   However,
  such assumptions may not hold in many practical situations.   In this paper, we
  consider the situation where a treatment is associated with a response through a
  set of supplementary variables in both linear and discrete models.   Then, we show
  that the estimation accuracy of the causal effect can be improved by using the supplementary
  variables.   Different from Cox (1960), the results of this paper are derived without
  the assumption of Gaussian error terms in linear models or dichotomous variables
  in discrete models.   The results of this paper help us to obtain the reliable evaluation
  of causal effects from observed data.
